I made a post on this blog earlier this semester containing a sort of response to Foreman&#8217;s piece on machine learning and data privacy. The recent class discussion has brought a thought to my head that I didn&#8217;t get to mention in class and thought was worth sharing. On his blog, Foreman wrote that &#8216;humans are bad at discerning the value of their data&#8217;. While I don&#8217;t intend to staunchly disagree with this since it is quite visibly true, I would like to focus on how much we actually care about the &#8216;exhaust out of life&#8217;s tailpipe&#8217;. After reading about the &#8216;quantified selfers&#8217;, I realize that it is entirely possible to care about at least _some_ of our data, which I thought was interesting.

These quantified selfers cared enough about their data, their trends, to purchase one or more devices to track themselves. As Boesel puts it, it &#8216;is not so much narcissism, but nerdery&#8217;. The simple idea of and excitement from tracking this data shows that the Quantified Selfers actually assigned some worth to this information. The fact that most of the participants weren&#8217;t doing it for self-improvement, but for its own sake, seems to assign even more value to it.

Data means different things in different contexts.  It also carries a different amount of weight depending on who sees it. To the typical person today, their personal data doesn&#8217;t really mean that much to them, hence, they don&#8217;t care what happens to it. To the QS&#8217;ers, it&#8217;s a way of life. To an advertising entity, it may mean a lot of money. To a Silicon Valley tech junkie, it may be a hobby. To a call center, it may be a means to an end, such as improving productivity and employee retention.

I found a calculator online that attempts to put a monetary value on your data (from the perspective of a data broker). I can&#8217;t speak for its accuracy, but it&#8217;s interesting to play with, nonetheless.
