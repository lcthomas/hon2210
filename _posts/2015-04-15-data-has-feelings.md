On Tuesday, April 14 in class we had hoped to really delve into “feeling data” and what that means. Unfortunately, for much of the class, everyone remained silent; I too sat around, silent and with my mind wandering. Quickly, I began to imagine data and “feel” the atmosphere of the classroom. It felt like a harsh silence, a very distinct silence. This reminded me of the very nature of data, as I first would have defined it upon the start of this course.

As class proceeded and classmates and myself began to open up, I saw it as symbolism to represent the process we have journeyed across as a class.

Still, this is all data. Class -> over time -> changes variable _x…_

Given these thoughts, once the coffee book made its way to me I looked at the data visualizations not only as “data” but as a combination of art and data organized in a beautiful and magnetic approach.

In reading the articles we assigned we began to have a greater understanding of “**feeling** data” and I was really captivated. The qualitative realm of data is fascinating.

As in most of my blog posts I would enjoy to pose a few questions:

  1. Why did you feel responding was so difficult on Tuesday? 
      1. For me, I was still to much feeling the analytical approach and feared wasn’t accustomed to the idea of “feeling” data.
  2. Would you believe it possible to _feel_ quantitative data?
  3. Where did you our teacher buy the coffee book…
  4. Do you believe we feel all data? 
      1. I say yes. I am a firm believer that everything around us impacts us although I would not go on to say that our feelings allow us to interpret data with accuracy but rather emotion.

I wanted to include an audio clip for this post. It is by Billy Carrothers and is entitles &#8220;Data Has Feelings.&#8221; I found it very enjoyable to play this music in the background while taking a look at the flash animation from our class discussion. You should give it a try. How can audio by implemented into data visualizations? Can it? Can we have data tracks?
