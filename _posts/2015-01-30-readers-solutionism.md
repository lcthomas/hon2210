  <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">Solutionism, as presented in Morozov&#8217;s piece, read for class last Thursday, is presented as a simpleton&#8217;s idea of the world, a mentality accused of &#8220;reaching for the answer before the questions have fully been asked&#8221; (6). He goes on to use an example of a &#8220;smart kitchen,&#8221; ultimately tearing it down for the &#8220;more fruitful, more humanistic and more responsible ways to think about technology&#8217;s role in enabling human flourishing&#8221; (14). Is there really a way for us to quantify and judge what is more human and responsible, though? The quick fix, bandaid mentality is seen as a menace to other solutions, but for some problems, a solutionistic approach works. </span>

  <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">Take Parkinson&#8217;s disease, for example. Parkinson&#8217;s is a neurological disorder that causes tremors and stiffness that get worse over time, and is currently uncurable<sup>1</sup>. The direct cause is unknown, and while research for Parkinson&#8217;s is being funded, it could be many years before we even fully understand the disease, let alone cure it. As a result, one &#8220;bandaid&#8221; solution presented from Lift Labs is a camera stabilized spoon, which balances in the hand despite having tremors. In the video attached, it&#8217;s clear that this small gesture helps the patient feed themselves, allowing them more autonomy<sup><sub>2</sub></sup>. Is this a solutionistic answer? In the context discussed in class, yes. It doesn&#8217;t touch on any deeper causes or present huge results, but it is a small thing that makes someone&#8217;s life easier. Perhaps this is where solutionism fits in our society; as the bridge between understanding the symptoms and not understanding the causes. <br /></span>

   <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">I&#8217;m biased against Morozov&#8217;s mentality, primarily because &#8220;the will to improve&#8221; is the basis of bioengineering (my major). Many of the medical devices created today would be considered solutionistic technology, such as pacemakers (they don&#8217;t cure heart disease!), and insulin pumps (you&#8217;re still diabetic!). It might just be because of our time period, but we&#8217;re able to offer solutions that, while they don&#8217;t fix the cause, they fix the symptoms. As much as Morozov&#8217;s tirades against the idea that technology can fix everything, for some people, it allows them to keep living, and live a &#8220;normal&#8221; life.</span>
