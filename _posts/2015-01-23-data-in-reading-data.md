This Tuesday (Jan 20th) I recorded two different data sets. The first one I recorded was at the beginning of class. Since Tuesday was the first warm and sunny day Clemson had seen in a while, I decided to see how it affected what my classmates wore that day. Short-sleeves included students who had taken layers off, students who had rolled up the sleeves to their long sleeve shirts, and of course, students wearing t-shirts. Basically anyone whose arms were uncovered. Long-sleeves, on the other hand, included any student whose arms _were_ covered. I collected the data after roll was called. The results are as follows:

Short-sleeves: 7
  
Long-sleeves: 9

Since the previous week had been quite chilly with temperatures ranging from 30-40 degrees F, I found it interesting how balanced the class was. It is worth noting, however, that several of the short-sleevers had either rolled up their sleeves or removed a jacket.

The second data set I recorded was a tally of the number of times &#8220;data&#8221; was uttered during the class. This included data as part of a bigger word (such as database). The word was spoken aloud 58 times. Ostensibly, this value seems normal for a data-based seminar over a 75 minute period, but the occurrences were not quite so spread out. Of the 58 times someone said &#8220;data&#8221;, 57 were during the discussion of Manovich&#8217;s &#8220;The Database&#8221; and Hayles&#8217;s &#8220;Narrative and Database.&#8221; Only once did somebody mention &#8220;data&#8221; during the discussion of Ullman&#8217;s _The Bug_. Perhaps this can be attributed to a wider range of topics to discuss in _The Bug_ compared to the two articles. Or maybe after 57 times, the class (barring one individual) was ready to move on.
