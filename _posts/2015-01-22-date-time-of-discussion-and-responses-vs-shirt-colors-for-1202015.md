Note: Only multiple word responses are counted for this purpose.

**Observations:**

Despite how simple these two topics may sound, they were surprisingly difficult to record. Even something that sounds as simple as “shirt color” does not break down easily in the real world without making every single person into an independent category, and so I had to make judgment calls even in just determining shirt colors. In addition, when counting responses, it was necessary to add the requirement for multi-word responses, excluding single-word answers. This both simplified down recording when a question was asked that required a one-word answer and also ensured that the responses recorded were meaningful and that totals were not swayed by trivial instances. In the recording of time spent in different areas of discussion, another problem arose. In Hayles’s piece, she referenced _The Journalist: A Novel_ and explained that the protagonist’s attempt to classify everything he did quickly became interpolation _ad infinitum_ (182). Within my classification, I tried to avoid this by using broad categories of discussion, but this once again came down to judgment calls in determining what is a large enough change in topic to classify a new discussion category. Even in recording timestamps and shirt colors, it is difficult to classify the analog world into discrete data sets.
