You&#8217;ve been assigned a group and a constraint category about which to make observations. With your group, write down as many specific, concrete observations and/or interpretations about your category as you can. Write down specific page numbers whenever possible. The questions associated with each category are there to help you get started in thinking about what to look for. Assume there is more there than you can possibly hope to find in the short amount of time I am going to give you to do this activity; this means you should keep trying to find things until our time is up, even if you &#8220;run out&#8221; of questions.
