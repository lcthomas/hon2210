During class on Tuesday, I decided to count the number of times Ethan&#8217;s emotions were discussed and what words were used to describe them. I chose to observe this because the general consensus so far was that Ethan had or showed emotions very rarely. His emotions were brought up three times in Tuesday&#8217;s class and the main words used are listed below:

  1. Mechanical
  2. Binary
  3. Unable to deal with non-binary

I also counted the number of people that said &#8220;bless you&#8221; when someone sneezed: 4

However, in class on Thursday, I thought it would be interesting to observe the number of times Ethan&#8217;s emotions were brought up in comparison to the previous class. There were five instances, and the descriptions were much different than on Tuesday:

  1. Broken, humiliated
  2. Cold, alone
  3. Different than before, not mechanical, becoming humanized, can’t hold them in
  4. Neediness for human interaction
  5. Frightened by women

Thankfully, to keep my observing consistent, the same person sneezed in class on Thursday. This time: 3 bless you&#8217;s.
