The argument that I made in my paper (Part 1) is that truth is a paradox in the context of &#8220;The Library of Babel.&#8221;  Data can contradict itself, which leads us to believe that truth that honors all sides of data is not possible.  Therefore, truth is a paradox because it seems to be false, but it is actually true.  The problem that humans face is acknowledging that truth doesn&#8217;t have to make logical sense.  Objectivity acts as a human-made limitation to truth.  I conclude that this is the reason for the various different perspectives on the origin and contents of the Library.  Humans attempt to find truth through logical reasoning, so our only way to make sense of contradictory data is to ignore one side of the data.  Real truth is unattainable with this method because it doesn&#8217;t explain how the other perspectives are wrong; instead, it solely focuses on data that confirms their side.

I chose to present Part 2 of my final project in a video format because it allowed me to reach the audience in a more personal manner.  My paper in Part 1 explains my interpretation of truth in the context of the literary text, but a video format makes the message more &#8220;real&#8221; and relatable.  Rather than just talking about the Library, I was able to give real world examples of paradoxes that confuse us and stretch our thinking.  Being able to see it visually makes it easier to comprehend the difficult concept.
