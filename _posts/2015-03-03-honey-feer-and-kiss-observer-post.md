The first of the three “textured” words that I found was the word “honey.” It is used in both Sam and Hailey’s section a total of 15 times. In several instances it is used to accompany a happy scene to provide a feeling of sweetness. For example, it is used when Hailey says, “Sonneyastounded kisses my mouth. Mistletoe whisks: Consume only this. HONEY!” (Hailey 42). The word “honey” in this instance represents a feeling of bliss or elation. However, throughout the novel, the word “honey” is used with a numerical value. The further into the book it is used, the less the number of “jars left” continuously decreases, implying that the sweetness is depleting. I thought this was interesting because it suggests that there is an end in sight, which contradicts the circular structure of the novel.

&nbsp;

The next word that I investigated was “feer.” It is used in place of the word “fear.” For example, when Sam thinks Hailey is lost he says that “feer begets every regret.” I tried to find the definition of “feer” to determine its meaning in the context of _Only Revolutions_, but my results were minimal. One site even said that “feer” is not commonly included in the English dictionary but the definitions that I did find ranged from “to mark off land for plowing” to the adjective “correct.” I was unable to determine Danielewski’s intention for using this word, but it is worth noting or further investigating.

&nbsp;

The final word that I looked at in the Search Inside the Book feature was “kiss.” I searched this word because I haven’t been able to read for more than 15 minutes without coming across another sex or intimate scene between Hailey and Sam, so I was curious about how many times the word was used. My search found 30 results. I actually would have expected it to occur more than just 30 times. Perhaps this number represents the typical number of days in a month, which would reinforce the theme of time moving forwards, but this is just speculation.

&nbsp;

The process of searching for these words was confusing at first. After searching for the words and using the page numbers from the site to locate them in the book I could not find some of the words. I read the pages over and over again, and still nothing. Then I realized that the word could be on the upside down part of the page and still count as being on that page. Technically, if I have to flip the book, then I am now on a different page number, but the Search Inside the Book feature did not seem to recognize that.
