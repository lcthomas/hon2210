During class on Thursday, January 23rd, I chose to observe the amount of times people talked during class in respect to where they were sitting and what medium they were using to take notes. I was hoping these observations would help a student determine the best place to sit during class and the form of medium best for taking notes.Â For the first observation I divided the room into four different sections: front, left, right and back. I designated the front section to be the row of tables near the television where Dr. Thomas sits and the other sections were named from her perspective when she looks out to the class. Therefore, the left section is the side near the dry-erase boards, the right section is the one opposite of that and the back section is the tables near both doors. I then recorded how many times students spoke in each section and found the following data:

<table style="height: 335px" width="446">
  <tr>
    <td width="111">
      <p style="text-align: center">
        <strong>Section</strong>
      </p>
    </td>
    
    <td style="text-align: center" width="111">
      <strong>Number of Students</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td style="text-align: center" width="111">
      <strong>Amount of Times Responding</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td style="text-align: center" width="111">
      <p style="text-align: center">
        <strong>Average Responses per Person</strong>
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td width="111">
      <p style="text-align: center">
        <strong>Front</strong>
      </p>

    <td width="111">

    <td width="111">
      <p style="text-align: center">
        2.00
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For the second observation, I chose to note the number of times students responded during class in respect to whether they were using a laptop or paper notebook to take notes during class. I recorded this data by noting what medium an individual was using every time someone responded during class and found the following:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="111">
      <strong>Medium for Taking Notes</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td width="111">
      <strong>Number of Students</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td width="111">
      <strong>Amount of Times Responding</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td width="111">
      <strong>Average Reponses per Person</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td width="111">
      <strong>Laptop</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td width="111">
      10
    </td>
    
    <td width="111">
      31
    </td>
    
    <td width="111">
      3.10
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td width="111">
      <strong>Notebook or Paper</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td width="111">
      7
    </td>
    
    <td width="111">
      23
    </td>
    
    <td width="111">
      3.29
    </td>
  </tr>
