As it was mentioned on the &#8216;Quantifying Kissinger&#8217; main blog post, the scarcity of information is the bane of most historians. Compared to today, there use to be only a few mediums which limited communication: books, letters, written reports, etc. Compound this with the fact that these items can be easily lost, stolen, and even destroyed, and you can see why this is such a problem. What was within reach of the humanities previously is a small fraction compared to what information is available today. Kaufman&#8217;s blog primarily focuses on the previously classified Kissinger Collection, but the point she mentions is extensible to other humanities as well: the high availability of data poses both an opportunity and a challenge to those who study it. There&#8217;s so much information available to those wishing to peruse it. But, on the other hand, _there&#8217;s so much data_. Who&#8217;s going to spend their time flipping through 17,500 meeting memoranda and teleconference transcripts? Few, if any.

On one hand, Kaufman&#8217;s blog posts on visualizations are a good example of how the humanities are adapting well to efficiently browse large sets of information. But while this approach allows one to see what is deemed relevant to a specific event, does this affect what is seen? Does this affect where attention is directed at? I realize the impossibility of devoting one&#8217;s attention to every single piece presented in the archive, but is this approach narrowing our view of the timeline of human history? This almost relates to my [earlier post](http://lindsaythomas.net/hon2210/2015/02/18/difficulties-of-computing-and-literature/ "Difficulties of Computing and Literature") about the fusion of the humanities and computing.

Each entry in the Kissinger Collection is a piece that had a part to play in history. This &#8216;distant reading&#8217; of history, like in literature, also abstracts one from the possibility of having an intimate understanding of what each piece is about and the part it had to play. It&#8217;s great that we have the tools within reach to sort out this historical information, but there&#8217;s no replacement for the human mind and eye when comprehending this information (yet). As long as we&#8217;re not letting computers define our history for us, I can see this as an excellent method of study.
