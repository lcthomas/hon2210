I really, really didn&#8217;t like reading The Bug. I thought Ullman&#8217;s prose was gross, her characters unlikable, and her story a melodramatic heap of pointless computer-related tragedy. As a logic-driven person who doesn&#8217;t like to find meaning where there doesn&#8217;t need to be any, I tend to have difficulties dealing with a story that people tell me is deep and insightful while I&#8217;m wondering if the fun-to-read part of the book is hiding in the last two pages. So in lieu of writing about literary meaning that I know I&#8217;d be making up as I go, I&#8217;m going to complain about Ethan.

Ethan is a great example of a typical programmer.

Just kidding. Ethan is a great example of a sociopath who really shouldn&#8217;t be in computing.

Take a look at this comic by XKCD&#8217;s Randall Munroe:

    There is always a relevant XKCD.

I&#8217;m pretty sure that this is what an explanation of programming sounds like to someone whose mind isn&#8217;t naturally wired up in the weird way that makes code _make sense_. It&#8217;s also reminiscent of every time that Ethan blurts out the rules to his fake simulation of life. Ethan is great with rules. Rules are what turned him to the mind-destroying life of a computer programmer (what? It obviously destroyed his). Rules are what he&#8217;s certain govern life, the universe, everything.

Ethan&#8217;s &#8220;pattern of lights&#8221; during the entirety of his pitiful life was always all wrong to him: his creatures never _lived_, as he wanted them to; they only followed his rules. Then, suddenly, he added a rule that adjusted just enough numbers to make his creatures act a little bit more _real_. And then he&#8217;s furious, because there&#8217;s no underlying meaning, feeling, or emotion behind his pixels&#8217; new family-like activity.

Then Ethan finally does us all a favor and dies so we can go back to Roberta&#8217;s somewhat more competent perspective.

My point is that Ethan was always hunting for fairies and demons – the little bits of magic that made the world work (or make the computer crash), hiding behind seemingly straightforward rules and code. A dangerous mistake, in a world where computers are distinctly non-magical.

His impression of the eponymous bug, even shortly after its birth, was of a hidden demon that lived in the code, taunting him. The truth? It was a dumb little mistake from someone whose code he logically would have wanted to find as much trouble with as he could; an error that could have been found in much less than a year if Ethan had actually considered what would make his system explode when the mouse was involved.

Maybe he could have, I guess, but he gave the bug a personality and let it kill him after a long series of pressing buttons in a panic and not actually stopping to actually think (contrary to when he thought he was thinking). He wasn&#8217;t cut out for the dangerous world of computer science.
