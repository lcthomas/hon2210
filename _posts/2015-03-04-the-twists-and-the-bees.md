Johah wrote about the twists and the jars (and bees, a bit). I&#8217;d like to expand on his post.

I read the &#8220;leftwrist twist&#8221; as a bracelet rather than a watch (although with how vaguely they&#8217;re described, I could see the phrase referencing a watch, a ring, a bracer, whatever). I never considered the twists to be an indicator of time, rather (after Maddie pointed this out to me in a chat we had), an indicator of each character&#8217;s respect for the other. One of the data visualizations that the class examined on Thursday took up quite a lot of space to say that as time progresses, each narrative becomes more and more focused on the other character – Hailey for Sam, Sam for Hailey – instead of the protagonist from whose perspective the story is told. This transition is reflected in the narrative by the way each character [describes the other&#8217;s, and their own](http://vizonlyrevolutions.com/results.php?search=leftwrist+twist&haileycheck=&samcheck=), &#8220;leftwrist twist&#8221;: their own starts off valuable and becomes less so (H90, &#8220;my Diamondy Leftwrist twist&#8221; becomes &#8220;Leftwrist twist of Scat&#8221;, H309), and the other&#8217;s starts off cheap and becomes even more valuable than the narrator&#8217;s own had ever been (&#8220;Hailey&#8217;s Leftwrist Bronze Twist&#8221;, S90 turns to &#8220;Leftwrist Twist of Forever&#8221;, S309). As we&#8217;ve come to expect, the lines&#8217; placements counter each other.

On to the jars. The jars of honey aren&#8217;t quite as interesting as the twists, but I did find something rather neat: every [line from the main text that contains the word &#8220;jar&#8221;](http://vizonlyrevolutions.com/results.php?search=jar&haileycheck=&samcheck=) is almost exactly the same in both narratives, except for minor differences in terminology. &#8220;HONEY&#8221;, mentioned slightly more often, actually [tends to differ more](http://vizonlyrevolutions.com/results.php?search=honey).

And another note on pollen &#8212; I wonder where Hailey got her honey? She&#8217;s allergic to bee pollen. I guess there&#8217;s a case there for this entire story being a coma dream, which would explain quite a few of the time-based inconsistencies. Metals changing, less than 10 jars of honey _bee_ing enough to maintain two characters over the course of a hard-to-describe amount of time.

    I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this book hides time shenanigans.

The ever-relevant XKCD here isn&#8217;t quite as sappy as Only Revolutions, but with all the inconsistencies that keep popping up, I&#8217;m surprised that no scientific explanations like this have been presented to explain the book&#8217;s events.
