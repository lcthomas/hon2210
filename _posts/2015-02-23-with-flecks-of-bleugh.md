I wasn&#8217;t e<span style="color: #ff0000">x</span>pecting the sex scenes in Oɴʟʏ Rᴇᴠøʟᴜᴛɪᴏɴs, let me tell you.

Clearly subscribing to the concept that bizarrely **worded** depictions of se<span style="color: #ff0000">x</span> (&#8220;goo, sog and drool&#8221;. Lovely.) designed to be quite the opposite of erotic are automatically classified as fine literature, Danielewski also wraps his se<span style="color: #ff0000">x</span> scenes with deliciously disgusting filler (yes, I mean the gastrointestinal misfortune on page 50) and fast-paced, unintelligible conflict (that probably isn&#8217;t quite what the characters made it out to be), all presented ambiguously enough for it to be pretty obvious that this novel is supposed to be a work of art.

    Is my discontent that obvious?

  Period vernacular? New <strong>words</strong> formed from the bastard children of onomatopoeia and vocabulary even an avid reader would have trouble knowing all of? Weird coloration on every instance of the letter <span style="color: #993366">O</span>? Wacky layout, <em><strong>formatting</strong></em>, and occasional letterrrrrrrr repetition? Deliberate misspellings (&#8220;allso&#8221;)? Don&#8217;t worry if it&#8217;s confusing; it&#8217;s literature!
</p>

The more a novel is touted as &#8220;literature&#8221;, the less likely it seems I&#8217;ll have a good time reading it. Danielewski&#8217;s Oɴʟʏ Rᴇᴠøʟᴜᴛɪᴏɴs has been an annoying read (surprise!), although it&#8217;s managed to grow on me ever since I realized I wasn&#8217;t supposed to be enjoying it. Not the story, at least, or the characters, or the work as a whole – but the e<span style="color: #ff0000">x</span>perience of its presentation. Or something.

As much as I&#8217;ve been hating on Oɴʟʏ Rᴇᴠøʟᴜᴛɪᴏɴs, I have been enjoying the ebb and flow (if you will) of the te<span style="color: #ff0000">x</span>t itself. The **words** of New Orleans, for instance (p. 74, &#8220;Flaky dough and shortbread crusts&#8221;; &#8220;Crepe hangers and Sugary tartlets&#8221;), carried with them imagery that I actually enjoyed (contrary to almost every other evocative portion of the book). I&#8217;ve always enjoyed rhythm and alliteration, which is certainly something Danielewski has a hold on.

I&#8217;ve also liked realizing how contradictory the two flip-flopping (ha ha) narratives are, both told from the perspective of smug-as-hell 16-year-olds that I&#8217;m pretty sure are both making everything up (an e<span style="color: #ff0000">x</span>ample of contrasting opinions: Sam&#8217;s gift of shoes around p. 55) I imagine that the juxtaposition of two perspectives would have been made all the better if I had read the book as it was intended (i.e. continuous rotation), but I read each 88-page chunk in one go instead of in segments. What a shame.

I&#8217;m no crazed arm-slicer, to be sure, but I think Danielewski&#8217;s overblown push for &#8220;wow, it&#8217;s literature!&#8221; in Oɴʟʏ Rᴇᴠøʟᴜᴛɪᴏɴs is going a little too far.
